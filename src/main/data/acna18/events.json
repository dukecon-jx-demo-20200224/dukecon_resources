In this talk, we will outline the progress made in Apache community for adding fine-grained column level encryption natively into ORC format that will also provide capabilities to mask or redact data on write while protecting sensitive column metadata such as statistics to avoid information leakage. The column encryption capabilities will be fully compatible with Hadoop Key Management Server (KMS) and use the KMS to manage master keys providing the additional flexibility to use and manage keys per column centrally.

Software engineers should consider not only the demanding requirements of scalability, operations, programmability and usability, but also they should accommodate new requirements like 'real-time processing aka streaming' for latency, system portability for operations, support multiple programming languages and machine learning frameworks for data scientists, among others.\n\nIn this talk we discuss the dimensions of evolution and show that an evolvable big data architecture should rely on Apache based systems. We validate this argument by following an use case based on Apache Beam to create a rich and reliable system. Beam and its unified model to express batch and streaming data pipelines cover also the portable dimension at the language and runtime level. Other Apache projects contribute to create a complete solution, from data stores like Kafka and Cassandra to execution systems like Flink as well as projects in the machine learning space.","onhold":false,"bio":"Author: Alexey Romanenko\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/aromanenko-dev\/\nBio:\nAlexey Romanenko is Open Source Software Engineer in Talend France with more than 15 years of experience in software development.

However, the design of abstractions for data ingestion (IO) is rarely discussed. This is unfortunate, considering that reading and writing data is a fundamental part of data processing. In this talk we intend to close the gap by describing Apache Beam's philosophy for developing IO connectors. Beam is a new programming model for unified and portable batch\/streaming data processing.\n\nWe will discuss how Beam's IO connectors approach correctness (e.g. fault tolerance, error handling) and performance (scalability, throughput, latency), and we will introduce a key element of Beam's IO philosophy - the idea that IO is no different from other data processing, and should be expressed via the same programming model primitives and be subject to the same ideals of modularity. This approach not only dramatically simplifies the implementation of IO connectors, but enables new dynamic patterns and APIs that otherwise would be cumbersome or impossible, e.g. reading data whose location is computed by the pipeline itself, sequencing streaming writes to multiple systems, general-purpose streaming of new results of a repeated query, etc. In some cases this approach requires a new programming model primitive, \"Splittable DoFn\", which we also discuss - however, in general  it is not specific to Beam and we encourage other data processing systems to adopt these ideas too.","onhold":false,"bio":"Ismaël Mejía is a software engineer with more than ten years of experience designing and developing information systems for financial groups, telecom companies and startups.

Traditionally, these systems have offered at-least-once delivery semantics, leaving the task of implementing idempotent processing to the users.\nThis talk will present a rationale for adding “effectively-once” semantics to Pulsar, which was achieved by adding a message de-duplication layer that can ensure those stricter semantics  with guaranteed accuracy and no performance penalty.\n\nApache Pulsar is a distributed pub\/sub messaging system that originated at Yahoo, where it has been powering many critical systems and user-facing products for several years.\n\nThe traditional API for Pulsar is derived from basic pub\/sub concepts, such as “subscriptions” and “consumers” that receive messages and “acknowledge” their processing. This model is very simple and yet powerful in that it allows you to build applications without needing to understand the underlying intricacies of the messaging system. The only drawback is that previous pub\/sub system offer only “at-least-once” semantics, leaving the task of eliminating duplicated messages to the application. \n\nSince the emergence of stream processing and more demanding requirements, messaging systems need to offer correct primitives to allow implementing “effectively-once” semantics end-to-end, in both the messaging layer and in the processing layer. Here, we use the term “effectively-once” to clarify that messages can actually be replayed multiple times in the presence of failure, though the effects of their processing will be equivalent to exactly once.\n\nThis talk will present the new APIs introduced in Pulsar to offer “effectively-once” semantics and will cover implementation details and performance testing results and provide examples of use cases that can greatly benefit from this new feature.\n","onhold":false,"bio":"Matteo Merli is a software engineer at Streamlio working on messaging and storage technologies.

Most standards are articulated around data formats (Well Known Text, Geographic Markup Language, etc.) and web services (Web Map Service, Web Feature Service, etc.) Those standards enable data transfers between server machines, where data are stored, and client machines, where data are typically processed (except with Web Processing Service). But in a world of petabytes of Earth Observation data, bringing data to the algorithm is not always practical; there is sometime a need to bring algorithm to data instead. Google Earth Engine, Open Data Cube, OpenEO and Amazon lambdas are examples of environments where data are hosted and computed remotely. In those environments, the OGC standards for data transfers do not apply as much as in the \"classical\" situation. Consequently each cloud environment defines its own, non-standard API for handling geospatial data.\n\nThis presentation will show how an old OGC effort — GeoAPI — could apply to the cloud environment for some kinds of problems. An example of remote execution using the same standard API in both Java and Python languages will be shown. We will present advantage and inconvenient of using a standard API. In particular the perceived complexity of international standards should be weighted against the problems of popular simple alternatives. Apache Spatial Information System (SIS) will be presented as a GeoAPI implementation with a focus on new features, some of them resulting from evolution in standards.\n\nThis talk is aimed to peoples having an interest in international standards applied to geospatial data, their implementation in Apache SIS, and how cloud environments may impact those standards. This talk will introduce some advanced features like dynamic datums in spatial referencing, but mainly as illustrations of the expertise contained in international standards.","onhold":false,"bio":"I hold a Ph.D thesis in oceanography, but have continuously developed tools for helping analysis work.

The questions is here: how can we use the new cloud-native toolset to administer and manage Hadoop based clusters? Is there any benefit to run Hadoop and other bigdata application on top of Kubernetes?\n\nIn this presentation I will show that Hadoop is not a legacy application but it could be run very easy in cloud-native environment thanks to the generic and distributed by design.\n\nThe first step to run an application in a Kuberrnetes cluster is containerization. Creating containers for an application is easy (even if it’s a goold old distributed application like Apache Hadoop), just a few steps of packaging. The hard part isn't packaging: it's deploying\n\nHow can we run the containers together? How to configure them? How do the services in the containers find and talk to each other? How do you deploy and manage clusters with hundred of nodes?\n\nModern cloud native tools like Kubernetes or Consul\/Nomad could help a lot but they could be used in different way.\n\nIt this presentation I will demonstrate multiple solutions to manage containerized clusters with different cloud-native tools including kubernetes, and docker-swarm\/compose.\n\nNo matter which tools you use, the same questions of service discovery and configuration management arise.

In such a heterogeneous architecture, it is imperative to have a unified query capability where data from one type of data source can be joined with data from another type in order to perform advanced analytics. At the same time, for performance reasons, it is crucial to leverage the underlying indexing and partitioning capabilities provided by each data source. \n \nIn this talk, I will describe how Apache Drill provides such a unified SQL querying capability over both NoSQL databases and files in a distributed file system. It achieves this through an innovative extensible architecture where the underlying data source exposes the artifacts, such as data locality and parallelization information, that are needed by the Drill query optimizer and executor. \n \nIn the case of a NoSQL database, Drill provides a comprehensive framework to expose the index metadata (if the system supports indexes) which are then used to generate index-based plans. While in the case of file systems, Drill supports partitioning of files within a single directory or hierarchy of directories. Filter pushdown and partitioning pruning optimizations are applied to reduce the amount of data read from disk. The talk will also discuss certain best practices about the data layout and data modeling that enable the above optimizations and substantially improve performance.\n","onhold":false,"bio":"Aman Sinha is a Senior Principal Engineer at MapR, the PMC chair of Apache Drill and a PMC member of Apache Calcite.

Traffic Router is a Java application that is tightly integrated with Tomcat in order to leverage native OpenSSL support and to benefit from its vibrant community. Our integration includes a DNS server that supports DNSSEC, a custom key manager that is integrated with Traffic Control’s management system, Traffic Ops, and it also includes enhancements such as a “delayed start” connector for Tomcat. This talk aims to showcase how Traffic Control, and specifically Traffic Router, can be used to securely route traffic for a carrier-grade CDN.","onhold":false,"bio":"Jeff Elsloo is a Sr. Principal Engineer at Comcast and a committer on the Apache Traffic Control project.
